* Completeness

** Complete the high-level GL binding.

Would be nice to bind newer versions as well, while keeping the
compatibility profile.

** Complete the high-level GLU binding.

** Complete the high-level GLX binding.

** Complete the high-level GLUT binding.

** Write an EGL binding.

There is a wip-egl branch with upstream documentation.

* Naming

** Mangle low-level binding names.

Probably we should do this only if this low-level bindings are good
enough.  In practice this means that output arguments should be natively
supported, and they low-level bindings should check errors as
appropriate.

** Document the naming convention.

Specifically we should document when a name changes significantly, like
when to use a "set-" prefix.

* Documentation

** Figure out how to incorporate low-level bindings into the
   documentation.

Often-times the high-level bindings just duplicate information from the
low-level bindings, but poorly.  To do this, we'd have to make a map of
how to organize the low-level bindings, probably according to their
section in the specification.

** Mangle enumeration names to link to the enumerator documentation.

** Give an @anchor{} to each API element so that we can link back and
   forth.

* Meta

** Mailing list?

** Web page for documentation?

Both of these point towards hosting on savannah at some point.  Figl
could become a GNU project but it will not have copyright assignment.
